<h2>ðŸ©¸ GIALLO DISCO ðŸ©¸</h2>
<h3>Party at Ren's Den!</h3>
Join us at <strong>Ren's Den (900 4th St SW) on June 21st at 7:00pm</strong> for <strong><i>Giallo Disco</i></strong> â€” a Technicolor Nightmare dance party. All to help fund <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucasilver01/" target="_blank">Luca Silver</a>â€™s upcoming horror film <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dustwave/red-razor-on-soft-skin-a-barbershop-bloodbath-in-16mm" target="_blank"><i>Red Razor on Soft Skin</i></a>. Weâ€™re spinning a lethal mix of Italo Disco, Synthwave, and Darkwave all night, courtesy of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/neuromancermusic/" target="_blank">Neuromancer</a> and DJ Rif-Rat.
<br><br>
Dress to kill, dance in the fog, and help bring Lucaâ€™s blood-soaked vision to life.
<br><br>
<strong>Show starts at 7:00pm.</strong>
<br><br>
<strong><i>See you there!</i></strong>
