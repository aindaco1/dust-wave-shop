<h2>ðŸ“° His Girl Friday ðŸ“ž</h2>
<h3>Screening at The Studio at WESST!</h3>
Join us at <strong>The Studio at WESST (609 Broadway Blvd NE) on June 7th at 6:30pm</strong> for a screening of the 1940 screwball comedy classic <strong><i>His Girl Friday!</i></strong>
<br><br>
Howard Hawks' <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032599" target="_blank"><i>His Girl Friday</i></a> crackles with whip-smart dialogue, breakneck pacing, and two of the sharpest performances ever captured on screen from Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. This is a rapid-fire and relentless film, setting a gold standard for screwball comedy that still feels electrifying today. With its razor wit, newsroom chaos, and romantic sparks flying at 100 miles an hour, <i>His Girl Friday</i> is best experienced the way it was meant to be: on the big screen, with a crowd laughing along.
<br><br>
Also, a Dust Wave short film right before! And a merch giveaway too! ðŸŽ¥ ðŸŽ‰
<br><br>
<strong>Doors open at 6:00pm, show starts at 6:30pm.</strong>

<strong>Only 45 seats available!</strong>

<strong><i>See you there!</i></strong>
