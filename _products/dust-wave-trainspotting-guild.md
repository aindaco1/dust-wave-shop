<h2>ðŸšŠ Trainspotting ðŸš½</h2>
<h3>Screening at the Guild Cinema!</h3>
Join us at <strong>the Guild Cinema (3405 Central Ave NE) on June 20th at 10:30pm</strong> for a screening of the demented black comedy classic, 1997's <strong><i>Trainspotting!</i></strong>
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951" target="_blank"><i>Trainspotting</i></a> is a visceral, anarchic masterpiece, launching Ewan McGregor into stardom and redefining cinema for a generation lost in addiction and rebellion. The film is propelled by Danny Boyle's kinetic direction and razor-sharp visual style, all set to one of the most iconic soundtracks in film history (from Iggy Pop and Lou Reed to Underworld). Hilarious, harrowing, and unforgettable, it's a wild ride through Scotland's underbelly that demands to be seen loud, large, and with a crowd.
<br><br>
Also, a Dust Wave short film right before! And a merch giveaway too! ðŸŽ¥ ðŸŽ‰
<br><br>
<strong>Doors open at 10:00pm, show starts at 10:30pm. </strong>

<strong><i>See you there!</i></strong>
