<h2>🎬 FILM NETWORKING + WHODONUT FUNDRAISER 🎬</h2>
Join us at <strong>Rio Bravo Brewing Company (1912 2nd St NW, Albuquerque, NM 87102) on March 1st from 2–5 PM</strong> for a film networking event and fundraiser!
<br><br>
We're raising funds for [Becca Elbrecht](https://www.instagram.com/becomingfilms_/)'s short film <strong><i>WHODONUT</i></strong> — a comedy shot in a single take! Every dollar raised goes directly toward supporting this Albuquerque filmmaker as she gears up to shoot at the end of March at [Fat Pipe](https://fatpipeabq.com).
<br><br>
🎟️ Raffle prizes · 🎲 Games · 🎬 Film networking · 🍺 Great local brews
<br><br>
Whether you're an actor, filmmaker, crew member, creative, or just someone who loves supporting local art — this is your chance to connect and be part of something fun and ambitious.
<br><br>
<strong>Let's help bring WHODONUT to life and show up for ABQ film in a big way!</strong>
