<h2>❌ CURE ❌</h2>
<h3>Screening at the Guild Cinema!</h3>
Join us at <strong>the Guild Cinema (3405 Central Ave NE) on May 2nd at 10:30pm</strong> for a screening of a seriously frightening J-Horror classic, 1997's <strong>Cure</strong>!
<br><br>
Bong Joon-ho really digs it apparently, putting Cure in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120825221053/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/902" target="_blank"><strong>top 10 greatest films</strong></a>. Either way, Cure is a gnarly little one to share with your fellow film weirdos.
<br><br>
Also, a Dust Wave short film right before! And a merch giveaway too! 🎥 🎉
<br><br>
<strong>Doors open at 10:00pm, show starts at 10:30pm. </strong>

<strong><i>See you there!</i></strong>
