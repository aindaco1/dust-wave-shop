<h2>🏎️ REDLINE 🏎️</h2>
<h3>Screening at the Black Cat!</h3>
Join us at the <strong>Black Cat (3011 Monte Vista Blvd NE) on May 16th at 7:00pm</strong> for a screening of the most badass racing anime ever, the 2009 classic <strong><i>Redline!</i></strong>
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483797" target="_blank"><i>Redline</i></a> is a jaw-dropping explosion of color, chaos, and pure anime adrenaline -- a film so visually ambitious it bankrupted the studio that made it. Directed by Takeshi Koike and hand-drawn over seven years, every frame bursts with impossible detail and kinetic energy, pushing the limits of what animation can do. Set against a blistering techno soundtrack and packed with intergalactic racers, surreal sci-fi worlds, and unrelenting speed, Redline is not just a movie. It’s a full-throttle experience. See it loud. See it big. And don’t blink.
<br><br>
Also, a Dust Wave short film right before! And a merch giveaway too! 🎥 🎉

<strong>Doors open at 6:30pm, show starts at 7:00pm.</strong>

<strong>Only 75 seats available!</strong>
